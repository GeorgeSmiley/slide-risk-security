		\frametitle{Evolution and consensus}
		The discipline of IT security management has evolved considerably over the last few decades. This has occurred in response to the rapid growth of, and dependence on networked computer systems and the associated rise in risks to these systems. In the last	decade a number of national and international standards have been published. These represent a consensus on the best practice in the field. The International Standards Organization (ISO) has revised and consolidated a number of these standards into the 27000 series.

			%	\item Forms a good base for further security measures
			%	\item Use “industry best practice”

			%		\item Easy, cheap, can be replicated

		 Aim is to provide reasonable levels of protection as quickly as possible then to examine and adjust the protection controls deployed on key systems over time:
		Over time, this can result in the most appropriate and cost-effective security controls being selected and implemented on these systems
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Combined Approach (2)}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Approach starts with the implementation of suitable baseline security recommendations on all systems
			\item Next, systems either exposed to high risk levels or critical to the organization's business objectives are identified in the high-level risk assessment
			\item A decision can then be made to possibly conduct an immediate informal risk assessment on key systems, with the aim of relatively quickly tailoring controls to more accurately reflect their requirements
			\item Lastly, an ordered process of performing detailed risk analyses of these systems can be instituted

				\item 	Legal and regulatory constraints
				\item	Provide baseline for organization’s risk exposure

		\frametitle{Terminology}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Asset}: a system resource or capability of value to its owner that requires protection. 
				\item \textbf{Threat}: a potential for a threat source to exploit a vulnerability in some asset, which if it occurs may compromise the security of the asset and cause harm to the asset’s owner
				\item \textbf{Vulnerability}: a flaw or weakness in an asset’s design, implementation, or operation and management that could be exploited 		by some threat
				\item \textbf{Risk}: The potential for loss computed as the 	combination of the likelihood that a given threat exploits some vulnerability to an asset, and the magnitude of harmful consequence that results to the asset’s owner.
			\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Asset Identification}
		\textit{\textbf{"What assets we need to protect?"}}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item These assets need to be identified and their value to the organization assessed.
			\item The ideal is to consider every conceivable asset, in practice this is not possible. Rather the goal here is to identify all assets that contribute significantly to attaining the organization’s objectives and whose compromise the organization’s operation. 
			\item A security experts may not have an high knowledge of the organization's oepration and structure, so experts for each area of the organization are needed for the process.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Threat Identification (1)}
		\textbf{\textit{"Who or what could cause harm to the assets?"}}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Identifying possible threats and threat sources requires the use of a \textbf{variety of sources}, along with the experience of the risk assessor. 
			\item  Organization’s define threat scenarios to describe how the tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by an attacker can contribute to, or cause, harm. 
		\end{itemize}
		
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Threat Identification (2)}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item  \textbf{Motivation}: Why would they target this organization; how motivated are they?
			\item \textbf{Capability}: What is their level of skill in exploiting the threat?
			\item \textbf{Resources}: How much time, money, and other resources could they deploy?
			\item \textbf{Probability of attack}: How likely and how often would your assets be targeted?
			\item \textbf{Deterrence}: What are the consequences to the attacker of being identified?	
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Vulnerability Identification}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Identify exploitable flaws or weaknesses in organization’s IT systems or processes
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Determines applicability and significance of threat to organization
			\end{itemize}
			\item Need combination of threat and vulnerability to create a risk to an asset
			\item utcome should be a list of threats and vulnerabilities with brief descriptions of how and why they might occur
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Analyze Risks}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Specify likelihood of occurrence of each identified threat to asset given existing controls
			\item Specify consequence should threat occur
			\item Hard to determine accurate               probabilities and realistic cost          consequences
			\item Use qualitative, not quantitative, ratings 
			\item Derive overall risk rating for each threat
		\end{itemize}

			\textbf{Risk = probability threat occurs x cost to organization}
		\end{alertblock}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Analyze Existing Security Control } 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Existing controls used to attempt to minimize threats need to be identified.
			\item Security controls include:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Management
				\item Operational
				\item Technical processes and procedures
			\end{enumerate}
			\item Use checklists of existing controls and interview key organizational staff to solicit information
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Risk Likelihood (1)}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Take the assets and the threath/vulnerability from the previous steps and decides an appropriate rating. It is related to the \textbf{likelihood of a specified threath exploiting one or more vulnerability to an asset}.
			\item When deliberate \textbf{human-made threat} sources are considered, this
			estimate should include an evaluation of the attackers intent, capability, and specific targeting of this organization (an high rating suggests that a threat has occurred sometimes previously).
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Risk Likelihood (2)}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item There will very likely be some uncertainty and debate over exactly which rating is most appropriate. The final decision will be taken by the management.
			\item The likelihood is typically described \textbf{qualitatively}, using values and descriptions such as those shown in the table.
